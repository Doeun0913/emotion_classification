Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize !\n",

I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . What did you do ? I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . Did he leave when you left ? Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . What did you do ? He followed me all the way home ! That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile .\n",

It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .

We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan .

People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people .

American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese .

You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts .

There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . And ? So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . And it's a brick ? Yes . I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?\n",

I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment .\n",

Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? 200 dollars per week . In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? Twice a week for work and once for shopping . In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . That's true . Ok , I will think about it .\n",

            "Duplicate text: Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob .\n",

I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . I see . What else ? We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs .\n",
